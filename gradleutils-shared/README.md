# GradleUtils Shared

GradleUtils Shared is a shared plugin base used by all of Forge's Gradle
plugins. This is meant to be a tool internal to Forge, but any one case use it
if they want.

> [!NOTE]
> The version number is intentionally shared with base GradleUtils. It will
> always be built alongside GradleUtils, but it is not published to the Gradle
> Plugin Portal or Maven Central, only to the Forge Maven at
> `https://maven.minecraftforge.net`.
